VBA code runs through stock data for a worksheet each for 3 years (2014-2016).
A summary is created for each worksheet showing Ticker, change in stock price for the year, percentage change during the year and sum of stock volume during each year.
Yearly change data is formatted in green for increases and red for decreases.
On the right of the ticker summary for each worksheet, the code pulls the data for greatest percentage change increase, greatest percentage change decrease and greatest stock volume.
